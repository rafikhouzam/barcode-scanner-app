Barcode Scanner App – Installation Guide
========================================

This guide walks you through setting up and running the Barcode Scanner App on your computer.

🛠 Prerequisite: Install Git
----------------------------

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Download and run the installer for Windows
3. Keep clicking "Next" through the setup (default options are fine)
4. After install, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:

   git --version

   If it prints a version number, you're good to go.

🚀 Quick Setup Steps
--------------------

1. Open PowerShell
   Type `powershell`, and hit Enter.

2. Clone the Project from GitHub

   cd Downloads
   git clone https://github.com/rafikhouzam/barcode-scanner-app.git
   cd barcode-scanner-app

3. Run the App

   Double-click the `run_app.bat` file inside the `barcode-scanner-app` folder.

   This will:
   - Automatically activate the environment
   - Launch the Streamlit app in your browser

🔁 Updating the App (Future Changes)
-----------------------------------

Any time there's an update, just open Command Prompt and run:

   cd Downloads\\barcode-scanner-app
   git pull

This will fetch the latest changes.

🛠 Requirements
---------------

- Python 3.13+
- Git installed (https://git-scm.com/)
- All dependencies are included in `requirements.txt` (you probably won’t need to touch it)

❓ Troubleshooting
------------------

- If Windows gives you a “protected your PC” warning on the `.bat` file, click **More Info → Run Anyway**
- Make sure Python and Git are installed and added to PATH
- If the app doesn't open: try running `streamlit run app.py` manually from the command line
